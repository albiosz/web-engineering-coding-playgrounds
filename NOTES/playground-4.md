# 1. Use React for the comment web component
- I have decided to firstly just migrate the `<comment-section />` custom web component to React and embed it in the DOM

# 2. Migrate the whole body into React
- Next Step was to move all the html from index.html to App.tsx

1. I copied the HTML into the return expression.
2. Adjusted the HTML according to JSX format.
