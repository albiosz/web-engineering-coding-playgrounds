# Comment Section - show/hide comment control button
The show/hide comment control button is not currently keyboard-accessible. Can you make it keyboard accessible, both in terms of focusing it using the tab key, and activating it using the return key?

## Change
- I corrected it already in 2. Step "Semantic HTML"
